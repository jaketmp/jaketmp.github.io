## Biography

I'm currently at [British Airways](https://ba.com), leading the development and deployment of data-science tools and techniques across the business.

Previously, I managed the informatics teams in the [Division of Integrative Systems Medicine and Digestive Disease](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/department-surgery-cancer/research/integrative_systems_medicine/) at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ic.ac.uk), leading the teams responsible for development and implementation of the research software and databases that underpined the Division's research.

Additionally I led the teams in the [MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre](https://phenomecentre.org), and [Imperial BRC Clinical Phenotyping Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/clinical-phenotyping-centre), that were responsible for the statistical and computational aspects of both centres data-acquisition programs, monitoring the ongoing quality control, maintaining the laboratory information systems that manage the work flow, and conducting statistical analyses of the datasets generated.

Other projects I worked on at Imperial include [FloriNASH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93672_en.html), an EC H2020 program, investigating the link between gut microflora and the progression from normal function to non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatosis (NASH) in clinical patients. My work involved the profiling of the structure of clinical cohorts, and integration of metabolite-profiles, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets.

While studying for my PhD in Computational Medicine, titled _Novel Computational Approaches to Characterising Metabolic Responses to Toxicity_ via _an NMR-based Metabonomic Database_ (pdf available of [my PhD thesis](assets/JTMPearce_Thesis.pdf)), I also took the role of Data-Curator for the Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology (COMET) project. In this capacity, I ensured the quality of the processed data as well as designing and implementing software to assist in the analysis of the COMET dataset.

Prior to my time at Imperial College, I studied Biochemistry at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk), and bioinformatics at [Birkbeck College](http://www.bbk.ac.uk). While at Sussex I undertook an undergraduate project in X-ray crystallography, and succeeded in growing the first X-ray quality crystal of the human protein Phosphoglucosse Isomerase, the structure of which I assisted in the elucidation of, and which is available from the PDB with the code [1IAT](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1iat).

Upon completing my BSc I undertook an MSc in Bioinformatics at Birkbeck College, London. During my time at Birkbeck my project work specialised XSLT-based transformation of XML for database manipulation and integration, with special reference to the Gene Ontology database and [FlyBase](http://flybase.org) genome repository.

### Quicklook Plugins for macOS
My early work at Imperial College involved extensive use of MATLAB for computational analysis of metabolic profiling data-sets. To better make use of native macOS capabilities with MATLAB, I wrote a pair of plug-ins for macOS to improve the integration of MATLAB with the operating system.

The [MATLAB quicklook generator](https://github.com/jaketmp/matlab-quicklook) (for macOS 10.6 Snow-Leopard and later) extends quicklook to give an overview of the variables in a .mat workspace file.

The metadata importer (for Mac OS X 10.4 and later) allows Spotlight to search inside .mat files, by indexing the names of variables within the file.

Additionally I have written a [quicklook plugin](https://github.com/jaketmp/ePub-quicklook) to preview [ePub documents](http://idpf.org/epub).
